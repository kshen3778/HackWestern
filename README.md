# HackWestern

A prototype of a game designed at the HackWestern 2015 hackathon.
Designed using Java and Android technologies. 
This repository contains the server components.

The game simulates tag using phones. A hunter will have a compass pointing to the direction of the victim and will attempt to get within 
proximity of the victim to eliminate him/her.
